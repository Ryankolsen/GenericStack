# GenericStack
Program to demonstrate Generic classes/constructors, stacks, and user input

@author Ryan Olsen
Demo to use generic stack program. 
Two blank generic methods are used Interface IFGenStack
Class GenStack has two generic constructors

User is prompted to enter numbers. The numbers will be stored in an int array. This array is 
then stored in an integer type stack to demonstrate the last in first out functions of a stack.
Results are printed to the screen

 This program also constructs a stack from a string array. It then constructs a stack from 
another stack and prints the result to the screen

Errors are handled by the StackEmptyException and StackFullException classes to prevent
the Array Out Of Bounds error from terminating the program
